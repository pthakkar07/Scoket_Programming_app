# Scoket_Programming_app

This project totally based on client and server architecture using socket programming in python. 
GUI is based on tkinter module in python

basic concept of network call should be clear like bind,connect, socket, IP address.
Few screenshot about my project at provided at upload.jpg.

This is single threaded application hence at a time only one application can send message. So if server sends message hence Client has to click on receive button to receive messge from user.
Scope of this project can be incresed if we used multi-Threading concept and it will work like real world application.
